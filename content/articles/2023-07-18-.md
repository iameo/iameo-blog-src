summary: _Hackathon to hack..._


[Machine Learning Hackathons](https://corporate.hackathon.com/articles/machine-learning-hackathon-guide-everything-you-need-to-know) serve as a recreational activity, for me. And until last night, my last indulgence — sometime around 2021;  pre-COVID-19 era, on the Zindi Platform. Half the intent is to acknowledge that I've recently taken up [DSN and Microsoft Skills for Job](https://zindi.africa/competitions/free-ai-classes-in-every-city-hackathon-2023) as a pastime with an underlying research angle, and so far I've come to enjoy the entire process all over again. It's thrilling to see how minor adjustments can move one up the leaderboard. Self-gratification and then, possibly, the inevitable shakedown as other similarly skilled data scientists improve on their model.

Basically, one's position on the leaderboard reflects only on some subset of the whole dataset provided by the organizers until end of the competition. Hence, _shakedown_. There are other technicalities (for instance, "overfitting to the holdout") to it but that would be a bore. [Read this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585) if you have an interest in the shenanigan that can be the leaderboard.

Every ML competition takes on the same format: Objective, Timeline, Data (partially or fully provided, depending on the learning; typically partitioned), Evaluation method, Prize(ranging from points to **$$**, even jobs), and RULES. And this one is no different:


>**Objective**<br>
The objective of this hackathon is to create a powerful and accurate predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses in Nigeria. By leveraging the provided dataset, you will analyze various factors that impact house prices, identify meaningful patterns, and build a model that can generate reliable price predictions. The ultimate goal is to provide Wazobia Real Estate Limited with an effective tool to make informed pricing decisions and enhance their competitiveness in the market.

>**Timeline**<br>
This challenge starts on 12 June at 13:00 PM.
Competition closes on 29 July at midnight.

>**...Rules**<br>
If your solution places 1st, 2nd, or 3rd on the final leaderboard, you will be required to submit your winning solution code to us for verification, and you thereby agree to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

The publicity of this notebook is to ensure participants can derive an idea or two from my implementation and perhaps get into the top 3%.
